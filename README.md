## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The launcher is fully configured through a single `config.json` file. Each tile is defined as a JSON object:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "Tile Name",
		"icon": "path/to/icon.png",
		"action": "action_to_perform"
	}
]
```

**Parameters:**

- `name`: Text displayed on the tile.
- `icon`: Path to the tile's icon image (relative to the app root).
- `action`: What happens when the tile is selected:

  - Website: `"https://example.com"`
  - Application: `"C:/Path/To/App.exe"` or `"notepad.exe"`
  - System command: `"system:sleep"` or `"system:shutdown"`

## üí° Troubleshooting

### Sleep button shuts down the PC or takes a long time to wake up

This is a standard Windows 10 behavior when hibernation is enabled. The `system:sleep` command triggers hibernation instead of a light sleep (Suspend to RAM).

**To fix this, you need to disable hibernation once on your system.** This will also free up several gigabytes on your system drive.

1.  Open the Start Menu.
2.  Type `cmd`, right-click on **Command Prompt** and select **"Run as administrator"**.
3.  In the black window that appears, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    powercfg /hibernate off
    ```
4.  That's it! Now the "Sleep" button will work instantly. To wake the PC, simply press a key on your keyboard or remote.
